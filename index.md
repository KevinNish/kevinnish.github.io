I'm currently working as a Jr. System Administrator for VDI Networks based out of Hamilton, Ontario. We are a North America wide Managed Service Provider specializing in VDI and cloud based services. I do everything from large scale Exchange and AD migrations,to building out custom environments to suit client needs. My main focus as of late has been revamping infrastructure to provide a scalable automated solution for future growth. I throughly enjoy creating process automation, writing infrastructre-as-code, and providing clients with a strategic partnership to leverage technology to grow their business.

Outside of the office, I'm usually either building some kind of gadget with a RPI or ODROID, playing some video games with my friends, or playing my Martin 00-28.

Over the last few months I have been able to cut down on provisioning and on-boarding times for clients by 97% by automating a majority of our processes. From the start of a systems lifecycle all the way to a user accessing the environment for the first time would have originally taken most of the technicians ~180 minutes, this same process now takes roughly 5 minutes
