Results-driven Systems Administrator with proven success in design, implementation, and management of enterprise-class
systems with strong experience in data-center operations across Windows and Linux platforms. Effectively plan, install, configure, and manage IT infrastructures to maintain high availability and optimized performance aligned with the organizationâ€™s goals and requirements.

Outside of the office, I'm usually either building some kind of gadget with a RPI or ODROID, playing some video games with my friends, or playing my Martin 00-28


## [](#header-2)Notable Projects:


- Created robust internal PowerShell modules to promote automation, repeatability, and consistency within our environment.

- Implemented a petabyte scale-out storage solution using GlusterFS.

- Designed and deployed a ChatOps style Slack bot using PowerShell, allowing us to port most of our existing PowerShell modules/scripts into easy to use utilities for our T1's and partners.

- Reorganized IT Infrastructure, simplifying the architecture, reducing costs, and increasing reliability.

- Built a client management dashboard for allowing clients to manage their hosted services (add/remove users, enable 2FA(Duo), provision/remove Office 365 licenses, increase/decrease virtual machine resources, etc.)

- Automated system deployment pipeline, from the front end client portal, to the provisioning of the back-end infrastructure. A once 2-3 hour manual process is now completed automatically when the client purchases the system.

- Deployed creative, low-cost solutions (often using open source software) to avoid vendor lock-in,  and promote code visibility.

- Planned and implemented a large scale Active directory migration strategy to move from a centralized configuration to a more modular, horizontally scalable hybrid solution.

- Planned and automated large scale live migrations on existing Exchange 2010/2013 systems up to Exchange 2016 and Office 365 using PowerShell.
