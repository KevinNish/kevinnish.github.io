I'm currently working as a Jr. System Administrator for VDI Networks based out of Hamilton, Ontario. We are a North America wide Managed Service Provider specializing in VDI and cloud based services. I do everything from large scale Exchange and AD migrations,to building out custom environments to suit client needs.However my main focus as of late has been revamping internal infrastructure to provide a scalable automated solution for future growth. I've caught the automation bug.

Over the last few months I have been able to cut down on provisioning and on-boarding times for clients by 97% by automating a majority of our processes. From the start of a systems lifecycle all the way to a user accessing the environment for the first time would have originally taken most of the technicians ~180 minutes, this same process now takes roughly 5 minutes

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
